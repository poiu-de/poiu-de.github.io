  - Provide JPMS module-info to be used in JPMS modularized applications
    The module-info will only be used by Java 9+. All other classes are
    still compatible with Java 8.

  - Provide `java.util.Properties` wrapper around PropertyFile

  - Make `appendEntry` methods public

  - Replace `setValue` method with `set`. `setValue` still exists, but is
    deprecated from now on.
