Some examples for usage scenarios of Apron are:

- Using .properties files as config files for an application that may be
  manually edited by a user as well as modified by the application itself
  (e.g.â€¯via a configuration dialog). The manual modifications (like the
  order of entries, as well as comments, empty lines and even the
  formatting of entries) will remain.

- Exporting and importing Java i18n resource bundles for translation (like
  [Kilt]({{< param kilt_repo_url >}}) does).

- Reordering multiple .properties files to contain their entries in the
  same order.

- Reformatting .properties files to conform to a specific format.
