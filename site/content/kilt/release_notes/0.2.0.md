 - Initial release of kilt after fork from i18n-binder

 - Totally new facade generation that generates enum facades

 - Renamed commands and parameters

 - Update XLS(X) files instead of overwriting them

 - Empty cells in XLS(X) and default resource bundles (without country
   code) are now supported

 - Added kilt-cli as commandline application without dependency on ant

 - Added kilt-runtime as runtime module for the generated facades (and even
   without a generated facade)
